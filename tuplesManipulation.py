Python Tuples

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable
"""

# to declare tuples, we use round brackes

tuple1 = ("green", "red", "blue")
print(tuple1)

# Tuple items are also indexed starting from 0 as the list and the string
print(tuple1[1])

#tuples are anchangable, i.e. we can not add, remove items after the tuple has been created

print( type(tuple1))
