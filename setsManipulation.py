Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.

#Sets are written with curly brackets
set1 = {"red", "green", "blue"}
print(set1)
#Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
# See the output of the example ( it will automatically remove duplicated items)
